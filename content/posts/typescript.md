## Why Javascript is not cool anymore
Due to the wide adoption of Javascript technologies everywhere, JS has become the bread and butter for a web developer. But the data type ambiguity in Javascript is the best thing for beginners and the worst thing for seasoned developers. Production code-breaking is the worst offender a beginner usually avoids thinking about. But seasoned developers have to deal with it every day. The best way to avoid it is to use Typescript.

## What is Typescript?
Typescript is just a superset of Javascript, developed by Microsoft. It introduces types to Javascript, which can be used to avoid production code-breaking. It compiles to Javascript, hence it can be used in any Javascript environment.

### Why use Typescript?
- Types
- Easy to learn
- Compiles to Javascript
- IDEs offer autocomplete and type checking
- Production-ready code
- Many popular packages support Typescript
- Can write JS code in TS files

Now you may say, this all sounds super good in fantasy land, why haven't people adapted Typescript widely already?

### Reasons I have heard people telling me why they don't use Typescript
- It's not Javascript
- It's not as popular as Javascript
- It's not as easy to learn as Javascript
- It's not as easy to use as Javascript
- It's not as easy to debug as Javascript
- It's not as easy to write as Javascript
- It's not as easy to read as Javascript
- It's not as easy to understand as Javascript

While a few of them are true, I think the reasons are not strong enough to not use Typescript. Let's debunk a few of them.

- It's not Javascript but a superset of Javascript, so it's Javascript
- It's not as popular as Javascript, but it's getting popular
- It's not as easy to learn as Javascript, but it's easy to learn 
- It's not as easy to use as Javascript, but it's easy to use
- It's easier to debug than Javascript. (Lost countless sleepless nights debugging JS code)
- It's easier to write than Javascript because you get auto-complete and type-checking with VSCode or other popular IDEs.
- It's as easy to read as Javascript, just has type annotation. 
- It's easier to understand than Javascript code. A new developer looking at your project can get an idea about how things are being passed around in a better way by understanding your types/interfaces of the entities or functions.



### Valid reasons people don't use Typescript
But there are some valid reasons why people don't use Typescript. Let's look at them.
- It's not as popular as Javascript
- Not all Javascript libraries are supported by Typescript
- Javascript introduces a comfort zone where a developer can write code without thinking about types and jumping to typescript may feel like genuine torture at first.

## Few tips to begin with Typescript
- When you don't understand how to fix a typescript error, use the type "any". It's better than not using Typescript at all.
- Use Typescript in a small project first, then move to a bigger project.
- When coming across an error message that you don't understand, google it. You will find a lot of resources to help you out. Typescript is a very popular language. 
- Tell your friends Typescript is the next big thing and act like you are the shit. This will make you feel better about yourself.
-  Write a blog about bashing Javascript and how Typescript is the future. This will make you feel better about yourself.

## What does the future hold for Typescript?
Let us look at some stats from stackoverflow survey 2021.
Typescript is loved by 72.73% and dreaded by 27.27%.
Javascript is loved by 61.51% and dreaded by 38.49%.
A Typescript developer gets paid more than a Javascript developer. 
Every open source library which is widely used is adapting or already adapted Typescript. 
So, if you ask me, I feel Typescript should be under your belt as a developer. 

## Where to learn Typescript?

Here, watch our lord and savior, Ben Awad. This 20 min video should get you started well.

## Conclusion
Hopefully, this blog convinced you to at least try Typescript or send it to your boss so you get permission to use Typescript. Types mean less run-time errors mean less downtime which means money. For developers, you will still lose sleep, not because of production errors, but of implementing types themselves. But trust me, once you start using Typescript, there is no going back (Every Typescript developer ever). If you are still not convinced, I don't know what to tell you. You are probably a Javascript fanboy.
