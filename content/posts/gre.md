## Why GRE and TOEFL?

GRE and TOEFL are the most popular standardized tests for graduate school admissions. They are required for most of the graduate schools in the US.

## What is GRE?

GRE is a standardized test for graduate school admissions. It is a computer-based test. It is a 3-hour test with 3 sections: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing.

## What is TOEFL?

TOEFL is a standardized test to measure the English language ability of non-native speakers wishing to enroll in English-speaking universities. The test is accepted by many English-speaking academic and professional institutions. TOEFL is one of the two major English-language tests in the world, the other being the IELTS. The TOEFL test is accepted by over 10,000 institutions in 130 countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

## How to prepare for GRE and TOEFL?

I prepared for GRE and TOEFL for 3 motnhs. Scored 322 in GRE and 114 in TOEFL. I used the following resources to prepare for GRE and TOEFL.

### GRE

Let us understand how GRE works in detail. It has 3 sections

1. Verbal Reasoning
2. Quantitative Reasoning
3. Analytical Writing

The first two sections are scored on a scale of 130-170, and the Analytical Writing section is scored on a scale of 0-6 in half-point increments. The total score is the sum of the three scaled scores.

The structure of the exam goes like:

1. Verbal Reasoning
2. Quantitative Reasoning
3. Verbal Reasoning
4. Quantitative Reasoning
5. Quantitative Reasoning OR Verbal Reasoning
6. Analytical Writing (2 Essays)

**NOTE: This is not the exact order of the sections. It is just an example. The order of the sections will be different for different people.**

Out of the first 5, 4 will be scored (2 Quantitative and 2 Verbal). The 5th one will be either Quantitative or Verbal and will not be scored.  The section which won't be scored will be one of the 3 repeated ones (either Quantitative or Verbal) and will come in random order in the sections.

For better understanding, let's take an example. Let's say you get the following sections in your exam:
3 Quant and 2 verbals, 2 Quants out of 3 will be evaluated BUT the one which will not be evaluated will be random and there is no way to know it.

#### Verbal Reasoning

Verbal Reasoning measures the ability to analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from it. Now there is a lot of confusion and debate about which word list is better and how to go about learning the words. I would say, use Vocabulary App by Magoosh, it is the best and easiest, most relevant list of words appearing in GRE (Link Below). For practicing the questions, use Manhattan 5lb Book of GRE Verbal Practice Questions (Link Below). It is the best book for practicing Verbal questions. 

#### Quantitative Reasoning

Quantitative Reasoning measures the ability to reason quantitatively, to analyze and solve quantitative problems, and to interpret data. For practicing the questions, use Manhattan 5lb Book of GRE Practice Questions (Link Below). It is the best book for practicing Quantitative questions. 

#### Analytical Writing

Watch Magoosh lectures on YouTube or get hold of it from Magoosh website. It is the best resource for preparing for Analytical Writing. Also read all essays from your 5lb book. Nothing else is required.

### Tips and Common Mistakes/Questions

1. How much time should I spend for preparing for GRE? -> 3 Months
2. Do I need to join any classes for the same? -> No, you can do it on your own. I did it on my own. As a matter of fact, noticed my peers who self studied scored more than my other peers who joined classes.
3. How many hours should I study per day? -> 2-3 hours per day
4. Is one book for GRE (the Manhattan 5lb book) enough? -> Yes, it is enough.
5. What is the ideal GRE score? -> 318+ and AWA score of 4+


### Exam day
Would require another blog to explain the exam day. But here is the gist:

***Keep a calm and cool head, know your time management and give the exam like it is just another simple quiz you want to ace. Do not think about the previous questions while working on the current one. Be totally unopinionated during the exam and you will be golden.***

## TOEFL

Does not require seperate preparation. Just revise your GRE vocabulary and AWA prepartion, check the exam pattern once and you will be good to go. I gave my TOEFL exam with 0 prepartion, just read the exam pattern and directly gave the exam and scored 114.
